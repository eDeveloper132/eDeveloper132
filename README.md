ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Web Developer & AI Enthusiast

Iâ€™m a Karachi-based software engineering student at SZABIST University, passionate about building dynamic web applications and intelligent chatbots. I love blending creativity with code: for example, I use Express.js and Next.js alongside HTML5 and Tailwind CSS to create responsive front-ends and full-stack sites. On the AI side, I work with tools like Dialogflow, Flowise, Hugging Face Transformers, and powerful language model APIs (OpenAIâ€™s GPT and Googleâ€™s Gemini) to make smart, conversational experiences. My approach is both professional and casual â€“ I write clean, maintainable code but also enjoy learning new tech, solving problems in creative ways, and collaborating with others.
